# Racing-Game-Board
This is a template game board used for Supplemental Instruction activities to track the amount of points for a total of 3 teams. The purpose of this is to divide everyone into teams and they compete for points. The goal of this is to encourage Supplemental Instructor Leaders to improve the program as well as develop new material and activities for students.
The code should be easy to modify for others to implement their own game board.
